work in progress logitech mx master 3 driver for chromiumos devices

will use web HID api in a pwa to collect usb data which will be intercepted by a chromium extension to control system functions

Goals:
- allow configuration of all buttons and side scroll wheel
- work without enabling dev mode
- auto start on boot
- be non intrusive
- have low latency, low overhead
- be easily adaptable or expandable to support other devices' unsupported functions
